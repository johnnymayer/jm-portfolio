                <p>I am a 32 year old Portlander with a passion for coding, music, and exploration of all things. I am currently on track to study C# and .NET with Epicodus in Portland, OR.  I am excited about the possibilities that coding may open up for me.  I am more excited about how I can bring this skill to the world!</p>

              <h2 align="center"><span style="color:#63A6B6">Background</span></h2>
                <p>After several years working in the service industry (driving a taxi, bartending, cooking, washing dishes) I was ready for a change.  I found that I really clicked with programming in just a short exploration of some simple HTML and CSS projects.  I am really looking to apply these newly acquired skills to help make the world a better place.</p>

              <h2 align="center"><span style="color:#63A6B6">Hobbies</span></h2>
                <p>I currently spend a lot of my free time working on music.  I record a lot of drones, soundscapes, and expiremental music.  I recently started working on an experimental techno record that I hope to release in my free time.  I enjoy being outdoors, and can often be found in a park, on the trail, or maybe even the beach!</p>

      <h1 align="center"><strong>Tips for Beginners</strong></h1>
    </div>
    <p align="center">Here are just a few tips for any beginners. Diving right into coding can be challenging, frustrating, and sometimes mind boggling. Rely on resources like the internet, <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange</a>, and anyone who knows
      a thing or two about coding for help!</p>
    <ol style="list-style:none">
      <li align="left"><strong>Read.</strong> Read as much as possible. I cannot stress this enough. Reading resource materials will help you to really learn.</li>
      <li align="left"><strong>Watch videos.</strong> There are lots of great videos available for reinforcement and supplement to reading materials. A video will often help you in getting a second chance to view a concept, and see its implementation.</li>
      <li align="left"><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Never be afraid to ask a question. Questions are the gateway to expanded knowledge. No question should be left unasked.</li>
