              <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">I am a 32 year old Portlander with a passion for coding, music, and exploration of all things. I am currently on track to study C# and .NET with Epicodus in Portland, OR.  I am excited about the possibilities that coding may open up for me.  I am more excited about how I can bring this skill to the world!</p>

              <h2>Background</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">After several years working in the service industry (driving a taxi, bartending, cooking, washing dishes) I was ready for a change.  I found that I really clicked with programming in just a short exploration of some simple HTML and CSS projects.  I am really looking to apply these newly acquired skills to help make the world a better place.</p>

              <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">I currently spend a lot of my free time working on music.  I record a lot of drones, soundscapes, and expiremental music.  I recently started working on an experimental techno record that I hope to release in my free time.  I enjoy being outdoors, and can often be found in a park, on the trail, or maybe even the beach!</p>
